# LAS Data Classification Using TensorFlow

## Project Description
This project focuses on classifying point cloud data from LAS files using a TensorFlow model. By analyzing various point attributes such as intensity, coordinates, and color, we aim to automatically classify points into predefined classes. This method is particularly useful in environmental and geospatial studies for processing and understanding large sets of point cloud data efficiently.

## Technologies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- laspy
- NumPy
- pandas (for data manipulation)
- scikit-learn (for data scaling)
- matplotlib & seaborn (optional, for data visualization)

## Requirements
To successfully run the project, you will need:
- Python installed, version 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x installed
- Necessary Python libraries: laspy, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn. Install these by running `pip install laspy numpy pandas scikit-learn`.
- (Optionally) matplotlib and seaborn for generating visualizations of the data and results.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local environment using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. Ensure all the required libraries mentioned above are installed in your Python environment.
3. Update the script with the path to your LAS file and the TensorFlow model file path as needed.
4. Execute the script by running: `python las_data_classification.py`.

## Project Structure
- `las_data_classification.py` - The main script that loads LAS files, prepares data, predicts classes using a TensorFlow model, and saves the results.
- `README.md` - Provides an overview and guide for the project.

## Results
The script processes LAS file data to predict classes for each point, which can be utilized in various applications like urban planning, forest management, and environmental monitoring. Results are saved in text files for further analysis or visualization.
